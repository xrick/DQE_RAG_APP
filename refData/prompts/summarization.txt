<Guidelines>
- If the response is empty, output: "No response provided."
- If the response is already very short (under 20 words), output: "The response is already concise."
- Please write your answer in Korean.
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, easily understood without e.g.
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.
- Answer in JSON. The JSON should be a list (length 5) of dictionaries whose keys are "Missing_Entities" and "Denser_Summary".
Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.
